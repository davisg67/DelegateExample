The logic to promote an employee can change so we don't want to hard code 
it into the Employee class.

1. Define the delegate type - 
   public delegate bool EligibleToPromoteDelegate(Employee E);

2. In Main() assign the Promote method to the variable, promoteMethod
   of delegate type, EligibleToPromoteDelegate. the promoteMethod variable 
   now points to the Promote method where logic is coded.

3. When the PromoteEmployee method is called on the Employee class
   a list of employees and the pointer to the Promote() is sent as 
   parameters.

4. In the PromoteEmployee() our pointer parameter is called, IsEmployeeEligible.
   IsEmployeeEligible takes the Employee variable as an argument to Promote().

Now the client who uses the Employee class has the flexibility of determining 
the logic on how they want to promote their employees. Delegates allow us to
pass a function as a parameter.
